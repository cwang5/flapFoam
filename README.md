# flapFoam
This is the files that is in the process of being modified to work with OF 2.2.x. It is not stable and most likely not working properlly.
EDIT March 4th, 2015: The code should work now. Make sure to run potentialFoam before simulation so it wouldn't crash out from the initial inlet flow.
